## Basic Gaming Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
This is the simplest form of a gaming leaderboard. When players finish a game, their scores are recorded and ranked against all other players. Anyone can view the top players at any time.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Player Submits Score**
When a player finishes a game, their Game Client (the app on their phone or PC) sends the score to the system. For example: "Player123 scored 5,000 points".

**Step 2: Request Reaches API Gateway**
The API Gateway is like a receptionist - it receives all incoming requests and checks if they're valid. It makes sure the request has proper authentication (is this really Player123?) and routes it to the right service.

**Step 3: Leaderboard Service Processes the Score**
This is the brain of the system. It takes the score and decides what to do:
- If it's a new score submission: Add it to the database
- If someone wants to see rankings: Fetch and return them

**Step 4: Redis Sorted Set Stores Rankings**
Redis is an ultra-fast in-memory database. It uses a "Sorted Set" data structure which automatically keeps scores in order. When you add "Player123: 5000", Redis instantly knows where they rank among millions of players. The commands used are:
- ZADD leaderboard 5000 "Player123" (add/update score)
- ZREVRANGE leaderboard 0 99 (get top 100 players)

**Step 5: SQL Database Stores Permanent Data**
While Redis handles real-time rankings, the SQL Database stores permanent data like player profiles, game history, and detailed statistics that need to survive server restarts.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Game Client | Player's app that sends scores | Users need an interface |
| Mobile Client | Same as above, for phones | Support multiple platforms |
| API Gateway | Receives and validates requests | Security and routing |
| Leaderboard Service | Business logic for rankings | Core functionality |
| Redis Sorted Set | Fast score storage and ranking | O(log N) operations |
| SQL Database | Permanent data storage | Data persistence |

## Scalable Gaming Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
This design handles millions of players submitting scores simultaneously. It distributes the load across multiple servers and regions so no single component becomes a bottleneck.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Request Hits CDN**
Before anything else, the CDN (Content Delivery Network) intercepts the request. CDNs have servers worldwide, so a player in Tokyo connects to a nearby CDN server instead of one far away. This reduces latency from 200ms to 20ms.

**Step 2: Global Load Balancer Routes Traffic**
The Load Balancer looks at incoming traffic and decides which server cluster should handle it. It considers:
- Which servers are least busy
- Which servers are geographically closest
- Which servers are healthy (not crashed)

**Step 3: Rate Limiter Prevents Abuse**
Before processing, the Rate Limiter checks if this user is sending too many requests. Rules might be:
- Max 10 score submissions per minute per user
- Max 100 leaderboard views per minute per user
This prevents hackers from overwhelming the system.

**Step 4: Message Queue Buffers Spikes**
During a game tournament, you might get 100,000 score submissions in 1 second. The Message Queue (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) acts as a buffer - it accepts all requests instantly and lets the backend process them at its own pace. No data is lost.

**Step 5: Multiple Server Clusters Process in Parallel**
Instead of one server, we have many clusters (groups of servers). Each cluster processes a portion of the traffic. If one cluster fails, others continue working.

**Step 6: Redis Cluster Shards Data**
One Redis instance can't hold 100 million players. So we "shard" the data:
- Shard 1: Players A-M
- Shard 2: Players N-Z
Each shard handles fewer players, making lookups fast.

**Step 7: Leaderboard Cache Stores Hot Data**
The top 1000 players are requested constantly. Instead of hitting Redis every time, we cache this list and refresh it every few seconds.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| CDN | Caches content at edge locations | Reduces global latency |
| Global Load Balancer | Distributes traffic across regions | Prevents overload |
| Rate Limiter | Blocks excessive requests | Prevents abuse/DDoS |
| Message Queue | Buffers traffic spikes | Handles bursts |
| Leaderboard Service | Processes requests in parallel | Horizontal scaling |
| Score Aggregator | Batches score updates | Reduces database writes |
| Redis Cluster | Sharded score storage | Scales to billions |
| Leaderboard Cache | Caches top players | Faster common queries |
| NoSQL Database | Stores all historical data | Permanent storage |

### Scaling Strategy
```
Current: 1 million players
Add more server clusters when CPU > 70%
Add more Redis shards when memory > 80%
Add more regions when latency > 100ms for users

Future: 100 million players
- 10 server clusters
- 20 Redis shards
- 5 geographic regions

    'explanation': '''
## Real-time Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
Instead of players refreshing the page to see updates, this system PUSHES ranking changes to them instantly. When someone takes the #1 spot, everyone watching sees it within milliseconds.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Player Opens Leaderboard Page**
When a player opens the leaderboard, their client establishes a WebSocket connection. Unlike HTTP (which closes after each request), WebSocket stays open like a phone call - both sides can send messages anytime.

**Step 2: Connection Manager Tracks Subscribers**
The Connection Manager keeps a list of everyone watching each leaderboard:
- "Leaderboard_GameA": [Player1, Player2, Player3...]
- "Leaderboard_GameB": [Player4, Player5...]
It also handles reconnections when someone's internet drops temporarily.

**Step 3: Player Submits Score via HTTP**
Score submissions still use regular HTTP (more reliable for important data). The score goes through the API Gateway to the Leaderboard Service.

**Step 4: Leaderboard Service Updates Redis**
The score is added to Redis. Redis returns the player's new rank.

**Step 5: Change Detection Monitors Rankings**
A background process constantly watches for ranking changes:
- "Player123 moved from rank 5 to rank 3"
- "Player456 dropped out of top 100"
When a significant change happens, it triggers a notification.

**Step 6: Pub/Sub Broadcasts Changes**
Redis Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) is like a radio broadcast. The Change Detection service "publishes" the update to a channel. All WebSocket Gateways "subscribe" to this channel and receive the update.

**Step 7: WebSocket Pushes to Clients**
Each WebSocket Gateway looks at its connected clients and sends the relevant update. The client's leaderboard updates without any page refresh.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| WebSocket Gateway | Maintains live connections | Real-time communication |
| Connection Manager | Tracks who's watching what | Targeted updates |
| API Gateway | Handles score submissions | Reliable writes |
| Leaderboard Service | Processes scores | Core logic |
| Change Detection | Monitors rank changes | Triggers notifications |
| Redis Sorted Set | Stores rankings | Fast operations |
| Pub/Sub System | Broadcasts updates | Decouples components |
| SQL Database | Permanent storage | Data persistence |

### Real-time Flow Example
```
12:00:00.000 - Player "ProGamer" submits score 10,000
12:00:00.050 - Redis ZADD updates score
12:00:00.051 - ProGamer's rank: 3 → 1 detected
12:00:00.052 - Pub/Sub publishes: "rank_change:ProGamer:1"
12:00:00.053 - WebSocket Gateways receive message
12:00:00.055 - 50,000 connected clients see update
12:00:00.055 - Total time: 55 milliseconds
```

### Why Not Just Poll?
Polling (refreshing every second) would mean:
- 50,000 users × 1 request/second = 50,000 requests/second
- Most requests return "no changes"
- Wastes bandwidth and server resources

With WebSocket:
- 50,000 persistent connections (low overhead)
- Only send data when something changes
- Updates are instant, not delayed by 1 second

  // DESIGN 4: Segmented Leaderboard
  static Map<String, dynamic> get segmentedArchitecture => {
    'name': 'Segmented Leaderboard',
    'description': 'Multiple leaderboards by time period, region, and tier',
    'explanation': '''
## Segmented Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
Instead of one giant "all-time" leaderboard, this system maintains multiple separate leaderboards:
- Daily leaderboard (resets every day at midnight)
- Weekly leaderboard (resets every Monday)
- Monthly leaderboard (resets on the 1st)
- All-time leaderboard (never resets)
- Regional leaderboards (separate for each country/region)

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Player Submits Score**
The request comes in like normal, but now it contains extra info: timestamp, player's region, player's skill tier, etc.

**Step 2: Leaderboard Router Determines Segments**
The Router looks at the score and decides which leaderboards to update:
- Daily_2024_01_15 ✓
- Weekly_2024_W03 ✓
- Monthly_2024_01 ✓
- AllTime ✓
- Region_USA ✓
- Tier_Gold ✓

One score might update 6 different leaderboards!

**Step 3: Multiple Redis Instances Store Each Segment**
Each segment has its own Redis Sorted Set:
- Redis-Daily: leaderboard:2024-01-15
- Redis-Weekly: leaderboard:2024-W03
- Redis-AllTime: leaderboard:alltime

This keeps each leaderboard small and fast.

**Step 4: Segment Manager Handles Rotation**
At midnight UTC, the Segment Manager:
1. Creates a new daily segment: leaderboard:2024-01-16
2. Archives the old segment to the Data Warehouse
3. Optionally deletes very old segments from Redis

**Step 5: Scheduler Triggers Events**
A cron-like Scheduler runs at specific times:
- 00:00 UTC daily: Rotate daily segment
- 00:00 UTC Monday: Rotate weekly segment
- 00:00 UTC 1st of month: Rotate monthly segment

**Step 6: Analytics Engine Analyzes History**
Historical segments are valuable for analytics:
- "Top players tend to score highest on Saturdays"
- "Region_Asia has 3x more players than Region_EU"

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Leaderboard Router | Routes to correct segments | Multi-segment support |
| Segment Manager | Creates/archives segments | Lifecycle management |
| Scheduler | Triggers time-based events | Automation |
| Redis Daily | Current day's rankings | Fast daily queries |
| Redis Weekly | Current week's rankings | Fast weekly queries |
| Redis AllTime | Forever rankings | Historical best |
| Data Warehouse | Stores archived segments | Long-term analysis |
| Analytics Engine | Processes historical data | Business insights |

### Segment Rotation Example
```
Sunday 23:59:59 - Weekly leaderboard has 500,000 scores
Monday 00:00:00 - Scheduler triggers weekly rotation
Monday 00:00:01 - Segment Manager:
                  1. Renames "weekly_current" to "weekly_2024_W03"
                  2. Creates new empty "weekly_current"
                  3. Exports weekly_2024_W03 to Data Warehouse
Monday 00:00:05 - New weekly leaderboard is live, empty
Monday 00:00:10 - First score of the week is submitted
```

### Why Segment?
1. **Fresh Competition**: Daily resets give casual players a chance to be #1
2. **Reduced Size**: Each segment has fewer entries = faster queries
3. **Historical Analysis**: Track how the game meta changes over time
4. **Regional Fairness**: Players compete against similar timezones

    'explanation': '''
## Competitive Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
This is for serious competitive games like Chess, League of Legends, or VALORANT. Instead of raw scores, players have a "rating" (like ELO or MMR) that goes up when they win and down when they lose. The system also detects cheaters.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Match Ends, Result Submitted**
When a match ends, the game server sends the result:
- Match ID: 12345
- Winner: Player_A (current rating: 1500)
- Loser: Player_B (current rating: 1450)
- Game duration: 25 minutes
- Suspicious activity: None

**Step 2: Anti-Cheat Service Validates**
Before calculating ratings, the Anti-Cheat Service checks:
- Did the match actually happen? (verify with game server)
- Was it suspiciously short? (possible win-trading)
- Did player stats look impossible? (aimbot, speedhack)
- Is this player's win rate abnormally high?

If suspicious, the match is flagged for human review.

**Step 3: Rating Calculator Computes New Ratings**
Using the ELO formula (or similar):
- Expected outcome based on rating difference
- K-factor (how much ratings can change)
- Underdog bonus (beating higher-rated players)

Example:
- Player_A (1500) beats Player_B (1450)
- Expected: Player_A had 57% chance to win
- Actual: Player_A won
- New ratings: Player_A = 1508, Player_B = 1442

**Step 4: Tier System Checks Promotion/Demotion**
Ratings map to visible tiers:
- 0-999: Bronze
- 1000-1499: Silver
- 1500-1999: Gold
- 2000-2499: Platinum
- 2500+: Diamond

If Player_A was Silver (1499) and is now Gold (1508), they get promoted! The system triggers a celebration notification.

**Step 5: Tournament Service Handles Brackets**
For organized competitions:
- Single/double elimination brackets
- Swiss system tournaments
- Round-robin groups
- Prize pool distribution

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Match Service | Records match results | Tracks all games |
| Anti-Cheat Service | Validates match integrity | Fair competition |
| Rating Calculator | Computes ELO/MMR | Skill-based ranking |
| Tournament Service | Manages brackets | Organized events |
| Redis Sorted Set | Stores current ratings | Fast rank lookups |
| SQL Database | Stores match history | Permanent records |
| Notification Service | Sends rank-up alerts | Player engagement |
| Admin Dashboard | Manual review and bans | Moderation |

### ELO Calculation Example
```
Player A: 1500 rating
Player B: 1450 rating

Expected score for A = 1 / (1 + 10^((1450-1500)/400))
                     = 1 / (1 + 10^(-0.125))
                     = 1 / 1.749
                     = 0.572 (57.2% expected win rate)

If A wins:
New rating A = 1500 + 32 * (1 - 0.572) = 1500 + 13.7 = 1514

If B wins (upset!):
New rating B = 1450 + 32 * (1 - 0.428) = 1450 + 18.3 = 1468
(Bigger gain because B was the underdog)
```

### Anti-Cheat Checks
1. **Statistical Analysis**: Is this player's accuracy humanly possible?
2. **Match Verification**: Did the game server confirm this match?
3. **Win Trading Detection**: Same two players playing repeatedly?
4. **Smurf Detection**: New account with pro-level performance?

## Social Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
Being #50,000 globally doesn't feel great. But being #3 among your friends? That's motivating! This system shows players how they rank compared to friends and guild members.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Player Requests Friends Leaderboard**
"Show me how I rank among my friends" - the request includes the player's ID and asks for the friends-only view.

**Step 2: Social Graph Service Fetches Relationships**
The Social Graph is a database of who is friends with whom:
- Player_A's friends: [Player_B, Player_C, Player_D, Player_E]
This is stored in a Graph Database optimized for relationship queries.

**Step 3: Leaderboard Service Gets Friend Scores**
Now we know the friend list, we fetch their scores from Redis:
- Player_B: 5,000 points
- Player_C: 3,500 points
- Player_A (you): 4,200 points
- Player_D: 4,100 points
- Player_E: 2,000 points

**Step 4: Calculate Relative Rankings**
Sort and rank:
1. Player_B: 5,000 ← Your friend is #1
2. Player_A (YOU): 4,200 ← You're #2 among friends!
3. Player_D: 4,100
4. Player_C: 3,500
5. Player_E: 2,000

**Step 5: Guild Service Aggregates Team Scores**
Guilds (clans/teams) compete as groups:
- Sum all member scores
- Average member score
- Top 10 members count
Guild rankings show which team is best overall.

**Step 6: Activity Feed Shows Updates**
Social features need a news feed:
- "Player_B just beat your high score!"
- "Your guild moved to #5 in the region!"
- "Player_C challenged you to beat their score"

## Multi-Game Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
This is a platform that provides leaderboards for multiple different games. Think of it like Steam achievements or Xbox Live gamerscore - one system serving thousands of games.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Game Developer Registers Their Game**
Before using the platform, a game developer registers:
- Game name: "Space Shooter 3000"
- Leaderboard type: High score (higher is better)
- Score format: Integer
- Max players: 1,000,000
- Regions: Global, USA, EU, Asia

**Step 2: Game Registry Stores Configuration**
Each game has its own configuration stored in the registry, including scoring rules, segments, anti-cheat settings, and rate limits.

**Step 3: Players Submit Scores with Game ID**
When a player finishes a game, the request includes the game ID so the system knows which leaderboard to update.

**Step 4: Multi-Tenant Isolation**
Each game's data is completely separate using namespaces. No game can see another game's data.

**Step 5: Score Normalizer (Optional)**
Some platforms have cross-game rankings. The Normalizer converts different scoring systems to a common scale for comparison.

**Step 6: Admin Dashboard for Developers**
Each game developer has access to real-time player counts, score distribution charts, cheater reports, and API usage.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| API Gateway | Routes requests by game_id | Multi-tenant entry |
| Game Registry | Stores game configurations | Per-game settings |
| Leaderboard Service | Core ranking logic | Shared infrastructure |
| Score Normalizer | Cross-game comparisons | Unified rankings |
| Redis Cluster | Namespaced by game | Isolated storage |
| NoSQL Database | Stores all game data | Permanent records |
| Admin Dashboard | Developer portal | Self-service management |

### Multi-Tenancy Benefits
1. **For Developers**: No need to build leaderboard from scratch
2. **For Platform**: Economy of scale, one team maintains everything
3. **For Players**: Consistent experience across games
4. **For Business**: Usage-based pricing model

## Analytics Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
This goes beyond just showing rankings - it provides deep analytics about player behavior, game balance, and business metrics. Game designers use this to make the game better.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Event Collector Captures Everything**
Every action is an event:
- "Player_A started game at 14:00:00"
- "Player_A scored 500 points at 14:01:30"
- "Player_A paused game at 14:02:00"
- "Player_A finished game with 5000 points at 14:05:00"

The Event Collector ingests millions of events per second.

**Step 2: Stream Processor Analyzes in Real-Time**
As events flow in, the Stream Processor computes real-time player counts, score per minute rates, and anomaly detection.

**Step 3: Leaderboard Service Updates Rankings**
Score events are forwarded to update the actual leaderboard. This is the same as other designs.

**Step 4: Time Series Database Stores Metrics**
Unlike SQL (stores current state), Time Series databases store how things change over time, enabling historical analysis.

**Step 5: Analytics Engine Runs Complex Queries**
Daily batch jobs analyze score distribution, player churn by rank, and game balance issues.

**Step 6: Dashboard Visualizes Insights**
Product managers and game designers see charts of player progression, heatmaps of where players struggle, and cohort analysis.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Event Collector | Captures all player actions | Raw data ingestion |
| Stream Processor | Real-time event analysis | Immediate insights |
| Leaderboard Service | Updates rankings | Core functionality |
| Time Series DB | Stores metrics over time | Historical tracking |
| Analytics Engine | Complex data analysis | Deep insights |
| Data Warehouse | Long-term storage | Business intelligence |
| Admin Dashboard | Visualizations | Decision making |

### Business Value
1. **Game Balance**: Is the scoring system fair?
2. **Player Retention**: At what rank do players quit?
3. **Monetization**: Do paying players rank higher?
4. **Competitive Health**: Is the meta stale?

    'description': 'Cloud-native serverless leaderboard with auto-scaling',
    'explanation': '''
## Serverless Leaderboard Architecture

### What This System Does
This leaderboard runs entirely on cloud services with no servers to manage. You pay only for what you use - perfect for games with unpredictable traffic or indie developers.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Request Hits Managed API Gateway**
AWS API Gateway, Google Cloud Endpoints, or similar. These are fully managed - you just define endpoints, no server configuration needed.

**Step 2: Cloud Function Invoked**
Instead of a running server, your code exists as "functions" that are invoked on-demand:
- Submit Score Function: Triggered by POST /scores
- Get Leaderboard Function: Triggered by GET /leaderboard

These functions start in ~100ms (cold start) or ~10ms (warm).

**Step 3: Functions Access Managed Redis**
Cloud providers offer managed Redis like AWS ElastiCache or Google Memorystore. Same Redis commands, but someone else handles the infrastructure.

**Step 4: Event Stream for Async Processing**
For heavy operations like analytics or notifications, functions publish events to streams like AWS EventBridge or Google Pub/Sub. Other functions subscribe and process asynchronously.

**Step 5: Auto-Scaling Happens Automatically**
No traffic at 3 AM? Zero instances running, zero cost. Tournament with 100K players? Automatically scales to handle load.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| API Gateway (Managed) | HTTP endpoint handling | No server management |
| Submit Function | Processes score submissions | Serverless compute |
| Query Function | Returns leaderboard data | Serverless compute |
| Event Stream | Async event handling | Decoupled processing |
| Process Function | Background tasks | Async operations |
| Managed Redis | Score storage | Serverless database |
| Cloud Database | Persistent storage | Serverless database |
| Auto-scaling | Automatic capacity | No capacity planning |

### When to Use Serverless
**Good for:**
- Indie games with unpredictable traffic
- New games testing the market
- Games with extreme traffic spikes (tournaments)
- Teams without DevOps expertise

**Not ideal for:**
- Consistent high traffic (servers cheaper at scale)
- Ultra-low latency requirements (cold starts)
- Complex stateful operations

    'explanation': '''
## Complete Leaderboard System Architecture

### What This System Does
This is the ultimate enterprise leaderboard combining everything: real-time updates, multiple segments, social features, anti-cheat, analytics, and global scale. Used by major game studios.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Player Action Enters the System**
Whether submitting a score or viewing rankings, requests enter through the CDN for static content or Load Balancer for dynamic content.

**Step 2: Security Layer**
Before processing:
- Rate Limiter blocks abuse (max 100 requests/minute)
- Authentication verifies player identity
- Anti-cheat flags suspicious requests

**Step 3: API Gateway Routes to Services**
Based on the request type:
- Score submission → Leaderboard Service
- Friends ranking → Social Service
- View rankings → Leaderboard Service (read path)

**Step 4: Real-Time Path (WebSocket)**
Players watching leaderboards connect via WebSocket Gateway. They receive instant updates through the Pub/Sub system.

**Step 5: Leaderboard Service Processes Scores**
The core service validates the score, updates Redis Sorted Set, publishes change event, and persists to database.

**Step 6: Social Service Enriches Data**
For social views: gets friend list from graph database, filters leaderboard to friends only, adds social context.

**Step 7: Analytics Pipeline**
All events flow to Stream Processor (real-time metrics), Analytics Engine (batch analysis), and Dashboard (visualizations).
