## Basic Collaborative Editor Architecture

### What This System Does
Multiple users edit the same document simultaneously - like Google Docs. When User A types "Hello", User B sees it appear in real-time. Changes are synchronized without conflicts.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: User Opens Document**
User A opens a shared document. The app:
- Fetches the current document content
- Establishes a WebSocket connection
- Subscribes to changes from other users

**Step 2: User Types**
User A types the letter "H". Locally:
- "H" appears immediately (no waiting)
- A "change event" is created: {position: 0, insert: "H"}

**Step 3: Change Sent to Server**
The change is sent via WebSocket to the Sync Service:
```json
{
  "doc_id": "doc123",
  "user_id": "userA",
  "operation": {"position": 0, "insert": "H"},
  "timestamp": 1642000000
}
```

**Step 4: Server Broadcasts Change**
The Sync Service:
- Validates the change
- Stores it in the database
- Broadcasts to all other connected users

**Step 5: Other Users Receive Update**
User B's app receives the change via WebSocket:
- Applies the change to their local document
- "H" appears on their screen

**Step 6: Conflict Resolution**
What if User A and B type at the same position simultaneously?
- Server uses timestamps or operation order
- One change is applied first, then the other
- Both users end up with same result

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Web Client | User interface and local editing | User experience |
| WebSocket Gateway | Maintains live connections | Real-time sync |
| Sync Service | Processes and broadcasts changes | Core synchronization |
| Document Store | Persists document content | Data durability |
| Presence Service | Shows who's online | Collaboration awareness |
| Cursor Tracker | Shows other users' cursors | Visual feedback |

### Real-time Message Flow
```
User A types "H"
       ↓ (0ms - instant locally)
WebSocket sends to server
       ↓ (20ms)
Server validates and broadcasts
       ↓ (20ms)
User B receives and applies
       ↓
Total: ~40ms end-to-end
```

### Why WebSocket?
Regular HTTP would require constant polling:
- Poll every 100ms = 600 requests/minute
- Slow updates (up to 100ms delay)
- Wasted bandwidth

WebSocket:
- One persistent connection
- Instant push when changes occur
- Efficient bandwidth usage

  static Map<String, dynamic> get otArchitecture => {

    'description': 'Classic algorithm for conflict-free editing',
    'explanation': '''
## Operational Transformation (OT) Architecture

### What This System Does
OT is the algorithm that powers Google Docs. When two users edit simultaneously, OT transforms operations so they can be applied in any order and still produce the same result.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Concurrent Edits Happen**
Document starts as: "HELLO"
- User A (at position 0): Insert "X" → "XHELLO"
- User B (at position 5): Insert "Y" → "HELLOY"
- Both edits happen at the same time!

**Step 2: Server Receives Both Operations**
Server receives operations in some order (say A first, then B):
- Op A: {pos: 0, insert: "X"}
- Op B: {pos: 5, insert: "Y"}

**Step 3: OT Transforms the Second Operation**
When applying B after A:
- A inserted at position 0, shifting everything right
- B's position 5 is now position 6
- Transform: {pos: 5, insert: "Y"} → {pos: 6, insert: "Y"}

**Step 4: Apply Transformed Operations**
- Apply A: "HELLO" → "XHELLO"
- Apply transformed B: "XHELLO" → "XHELLOY"

**Step 5: Broadcast to All Clients**
Each client receives:
- The operation they didn't perform
- Transformed relative to their local state

**Step 6: Convergence**
All clients end up with: "XHELLOY"
Order of applying operations locally doesn't matter - OT ensures convergence.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| OT Engine | Transforms operations | Conflict resolution |
| Operation Log | Stores all operations | History and undo |
| State Machine | Tracks document versions | Consistency |
| Sync Server | Coordinates transformations | Central authority |
| Client OT | Local transformation | Offline support |

### OT Transformation Example
```
Initial: "CAT"

User A: Insert "B" at position 0
User B: Delete at position 2

Without OT:
  A: "BCAT" then B deletes pos 2: "BCT" ← Wrong! Deleted A, not T

With OT:
  A: "BCAT" then transform B's position: 2→3
  Delete at position 3: "BCA" ← Correct! Deleted T
```

### OT Complexity
OT has edge cases and is notoriously hard to implement correctly. Google Docs team spent years refining it. For this reason, many new systems use CRDTs instead.

    'description': 'Conflict-free data types for decentralized sync',
    'explanation': '''
## CRDT-based Editor Architecture

### What This System Does
CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) enable collaboration without a central server. Each user's edits can be synced in any order, and the result is always consistent. Used by Figma, Apple Notes, and many modern apps.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Each Character Has Unique ID**
Unlike OT which uses positions, CRDTs give each character a unique ID:
- Character "H" → ID: {user: A, seq: 1}
- Character "E" → ID: {user: A, seq: 2}
- etc.

**Step 2: Insertions Reference Neighbors**
When inserting, we reference what comes before:
- Insert "X" after {user: A, seq: 2}
- This reference never changes, even if other inserts happen

**Step 3: Deletions Are Tombstones**
Deleting doesn't remove the character, it marks it as deleted:
- {user: A, seq: 1, deleted: true}
- This ensures consistent ordering even after deletes

**Step 4: Merge is Automatic**
When syncing:
- Compare IDs and relationships
- Insert missing characters in correct position
- Apply tombstones
- No transformation needed!

**Step 5: Peer-to-Peer Sync**
CRDTs don't need a central server:
- User A syncs directly with User B
- Both can sync with User C
- Any sync path produces same result

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| CRDT Engine | Manages conflict-free data | Core algorithm |
| Peer Sync | Direct peer communication | Decentralization |
| Local Storage | Offline document storage | Works offline |
| Merge Service | Combines different versions | Convergence |
| Sync Gateway | Optional server relay | NAT traversal |
| Vector Clock | Tracks causality | Ordering |

### CRDT vs OT Comparison
```
Feature              OT              CRDT
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Central server       Required        Optional
Offline editing      Limited         Full support
Complexity           Very high       High
Performance          Good            Can be slow
History              Full            Full
Peer-to-peer         No              Yes
```

### CRDT Text Example (Y.js style)
```
Document: "AB"
A = {id: (1,1), value: 'A', left: null}
B = {id: (1,2), value: 'B', left: (1,1)}

User 2 inserts "X" between A and B:
X = {id: (2,1), value: 'X', left: (1,1)}

Merge: A → X → B = "AXB"
(X comes after A, B comes after A but X has priority)

    'explanation': '''
## Presence and Cursors Architecture

### What This System Does
In Google Docs, you see colored cursors showing where other users are typing. You see who's viewing the document. This system tracks and broadcasts user presence in real-time.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: User Joins Document**
When User A opens the document:
- WebSocket connection established
- Join message sent: {user: "Alice", doc: "doc123"}
- Server adds Alice to document's presence list

**Step 2: Presence Broadcast**
Server broadcasts to all users on this document:
- "Alice has joined"
- Current presence list: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]

**Step 3: Cursor Position Tracked**
Every time User A moves their cursor:
- Cursor event sent: {position: 42, selection: [42, 50]}
- Sent every 50-100ms while moving
- Debounced to reduce traffic

**Step 4: Cursor Broadcast**
Server broadcasts cursor positions:
- "Alice's cursor is at position 42, selecting 42-50"
- Other users render Alice's cursor with her color

**Step 5: User Leaves**
When User A closes the document:
- WebSocket closes
- Server removes Alice from presence list
- Broadcast: "Alice has left"
- Alice's cursor disappears for others

**Step 6: Heartbeat for Stale Detection**
Users send heartbeat every 30 seconds:
- If no heartbeat for 60 seconds, user is considered "away"
- If no heartbeat for 5 minutes, user is removed

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Presence Service | Tracks online users | Who's here |
| Cursor Tracker | Tracks cursor positions | Where they are |
| Broadcast Service | Sends updates to all | Distribution |
| Heartbeat Monitor | Detects disconnections | Stale detection |
| User Metadata | Names, colors, avatars | Visual identity |

### Presence Event Types
```
Event           Data                  When
───────────────────────────────────────────────
join            {user, doc}           Document opened
leave           {user, doc}           Document closed
cursor_move     {user, position}      Cursor moved
selection       {user, start, end}    Text selected
typing          {user}                Currently typing
away            {user}                Idle > 2 minutes
```

### Cursor Color Assignment
```
Users get consistent colors:
Alice → Blue (#4285F4)
Bob → Green (#0F9D58)
Charlie → Orange (#F4B400)
Diana → Red (#DB4437)

Color derived from hash of user ID
Same user always gets same color

    'description': 'Tracking changes and enabling time travel',
    'explanation': '''
## Version History Architecture

### What This System Does
Google Docs shows version history - you can see who changed what and when, and restore any previous version. This system tracks every change and enables "time travel".

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Every Operation Logged**
Each edit creates an operation record:
```json
{
  "op_id": "op123",
  "doc_id": "doc456",
  "user_id": "alice",
  "timestamp": 1642000000,
  "operation": {"type": "insert", "pos": 10, "text": "Hello"},
  "prev_op_id": "op122"
}
```

**Step 2: Operations Form a Chain**
Operations are linked by prev_op_id:
- op120 → op121 → op122 → op123 → ...
- This forms a complete history

**Step 3: Snapshots Created Periodically**
Every N operations (e.g., 100), create a snapshot:
- Full document content at that point
- Allows fast reconstruction without replaying all operations

**Step 4: User Requests Version History**
User clicks "Version History":
- Fetch snapshots within time range
- Group by day/hour for display
- Show who made changes in each period

**Step 5: Viewing Past Version**
User selects a past version:
- Find nearest snapshot before that time
- Replay operations from snapshot to target time
- Render read-only view of document at that point

**Step 6: Restore Past Version**
User clicks "Restore this version":
- Creates a new operation that replaces current content with old content
- This is itself logged (so you can undo the restore!)

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Operation Log | Stores all edits | Complete history |
| Snapshot Service | Creates point-in-time saves | Fast restoration |
| Version Browser | UI for history | User exploration |
| Diff Engine | Compares versions | Shows changes |
| Restore Service | Reverts to old versions | Recovery |
| Attribution | Tracks who wrote what | Blame/credit |

### Version History Storage
```
Storage strategy:
- Last 30 days: All operations (full granularity)
- 30-90 days: Hourly snapshots
- 90-365 days: Daily snapshots
- 1+ years: Weekly snapshots

Trade-off: Storage cost vs. granularity
```

### Diff Visualization
```
Original: "The quick brown fox"
Changed:  "The slow brown dog"

Diff shown:
"The [quick→slow] brown [fox→dog]"

Deletions in red, insertions in green

    'explanation': '''
## Comments and Suggestions Architecture

### What This System Does
Users can add comments to specific parts of a document, reply to comments, and make "suggestions" (proposed edits). Editors can accept or reject suggestions.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: User Selects Text and Comments**
User selects "quick brown fox" and adds comment "Consider using 'fast'":
```json
{
  "comment_id": "c123",
  "anchor": {"start": 4, "end": 9},
  "text": "Consider using 'fast'",
  "author": "Bob",
  "created_at": 1642000000
}
```

**Step 2: Anchor Tracked**
The anchor (start/end positions) must stay attached to the right text even as the document changes:
- If text before is inserted, anchor positions shift
- If anchored text is deleted, comment becomes "orphaned"

**Step 3: Comment Thread Created**
Others reply to the comment:
- Alice: "I prefer 'quick' actually"
- Bob: "OK, let's keep it"
Comments form a thread with parent-child relationships.

**Step 4: Suggestion Made**
User makes a suggestion (proposed edit):
- Original: "quick"
- Suggested: "rapid"
- Shown as strikethrough/green text inline

**Step 5: Author Accepts/Rejects**
Document owner reviews:
- Accept: Apply the change, mark suggestion resolved
- Reject: Discard suggestion, mark resolved
- Either way, suggestion is removed from view

**Step 6: Resolve Comment**
After discussion concludes:
- Any user marks comment as "resolved"
- Comment is hidden from default view
- Can still be seen in "resolved comments" filter

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Comment Service | Manages comments | Core functionality |
| Anchor Manager | Tracks text positions | Stable references |
| Thread Service | Manages replies | Conversation flow |
| Suggestion Engine | Handles proposed edits | Review workflow |
| Notification Service | Alerts on activity | Engagement |
| Resolution Tracker | Tracks resolved items | Cleanup |

### Anchor Stability Example
```
Document: "The quick brown fox"
Comment anchored to "quick" (positions 4-9)

Someone inserts "very " before "quick":
Document: "The very quick brown fox"

Anchor updates: "quick" now at positions 9-14
Comment still points to "quick"!
```

### Suggestion Workflow
```
State: pending → accepted/rejected → applied/discarded

Pending: Visible inline, owner can act
Accepted: Edit applied to document
Rejected: Suggestion removed, text unchanged

## Rich Text Formatting Architecture

### What This System Does
Documents need more than plain text. This system handles bold, italic, headings, lists, tables, images, and complex formatting while keeping everything synchronized.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: User Applies Formatting**
User selects "Hello" and clicks Bold:
- Selection: positions 0-5
- Action: Apply bold formatting

**Step 2: Formatting as Operations**
Formatting is an operation like text insertion:
```json
{
  "type": "format",
  "range": {"start": 0, "end": 5},
  "attributes": {"bold": true}
}
```

**Step 3: Character-level Attributes**
Each character can have multiple attributes:
- H: {bold: true}
- e: {bold: true, italic: true}
- l: {bold: true}
- etc.

**Step 4: Block-level Formatting**
Paragraphs have block attributes:
- Heading level (H1, H2, H3)
- List type (bullet, numbered)
- Alignment (left, center, right)
- Indentation level

**Step 5: Sync Formatting Changes**
Formatting operations are synced like text:
- Apply locally immediately
- Send to server
- Broadcast to other users

**Step 6: Render Rich Content**
The rendering engine interprets attributes:
- {bold: true} → <strong> or font-weight: bold
- {heading: 1} → <h1>
- {list: "bullet"} → <li> in <ul>

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Format Engine | Applies/removes formatting | Core formatting |
| Attribute Model | Stores character attributes | State management |
| Block Manager | Handles paragraphs/lists | Structure |
| Render Engine | Converts to HTML/DOM | Display |
| Toolbar Service | UI formatting controls | User interface |
| Style Resolver | Computes final styles | Inheritance |

### Document Model (Quill/Slate style)
```
[
  {insert: "Hello", attributes: {bold: true}},
  {insert: " World"},
  {insert: "\\n", attributes: {header: 1}},
  {insert: "This is a paragraph."},
  {insert: "\\n"}
]
```

### Formatting Conflicts
```
User A: Make "Hello" bold
User B: Make "Hello" italic (same time)

Result after sync: "Hello" is bold AND italic
Formatting operations merge, they don't conflict!

## Offline Support Architecture

### What This System Does
Users should be able to edit documents without internet. Changes are saved locally and synced when connection is restored. This is especially important for CRDTs which naturally support this.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: User Goes Offline**
Internet connection drops:
- App detects offline state
- Shows "Offline" indicator
- Continues allowing edits

**Step 2: Local Edits Continue**
User continues editing:
- Operations saved to Local Storage (IndexedDB)
- Document renders from local state
- No delay or blocking

**Step 3: Operations Queued**
All operations added to an "outbox":
```
Outbox: [op1, op2, op3, op4...]
Status: Pending sync
```

**Step 4: Connection Restored**
Internet returns:
- App detects online state
- Begins sync process

**Step 5: Sync Pending Operations**
Outbox operations sent to server:
- Server may have changes from other users
- Merge/transform as needed
- Clear outbox after success

**Step 6: Conflict Resolution**
If others edited while you were offline:
- CRDTs: Automatic merge
- OT: Server transforms your operations
- Result: Everyone converges to same state

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Local Storage | Persists documents locally | Offline availability |
| Operation Queue | Buffers pending operations | Reliable sync |
| Network Monitor | Detects online/offline | State awareness |
| Sync Engine | Reconciles changes | Convergence |
| Conflict Resolver | Handles divergent edits | Consistency |
| Cache Manager | Manages local cache | Performance |

### Offline Storage Strategy
```
Storage Type        Content              Size Limit
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IndexedDB           Full documents       50MB+
LocalStorage        Settings, prefs      5MB
Service Worker      App shell            Cache varies
```

### Sync Queue Example
```
Offline for 10 minutes:
Queue: [op1, op2, op3... op50]

Back online:
1. Send op1-op50 to server
2. Receive op60-op80 from others (their edits)
3. Merge server ops with local state
4. Clear queue
5. Resume real-time sync

    'explanation': '''
## Access Control Architecture

### What This System Does
Document owners control who can view, comment, or edit. This system manages sharing, permissions, link sharing, and ensures users only see what they're allowed to.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Owner Creates Document**
When Alice creates a document:
- She's automatically the owner
- Default: Private (only Alice)
- She can share with others

**Step 2: Share with Specific People**
Alice shares with Bob:
- Enter Bob's email
- Select permission: Viewer/Commenter/Editor
- Bob receives notification

**Step 3: Permission Levels**
Three levels with increasing access:
- Viewer: Read only
- Commenter: Read + add comments
- Editor: Read + write + comment

**Step 4: Link Sharing**
Alice enables link sharing:
- Anyone with link can: View/Comment/Edit
- Optional: Require login
- Optional: Password protect

**Step 5: Access Check**
When Bob opens the document:
- System checks Bob's permissions
- Grants appropriate access
- Hides UI elements Bob can't use (Edit button if viewer)

**Step 6: Organization-wide Sharing**
Enterprise features:
- Share with entire domain (company.com)
- Inherit folder permissions
- Admin controls for external sharing

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Permission Service | Manages access rules | Authorization |
| Sharing Service | Handles share requests | Collaboration |
| Auth Service | Verifies identity | Authentication |
| Link Service | Manages share links | Anonymous access |
| Audit Log | Tracks access | Security |
| Policy Engine | Enforces org rules | Compliance |

### Permission Matrix
```
Action          Viewer    Commenter    Editor    Owner
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
View content    ✓         ✓            ✓         ✓
Add comments    ✗         ✓            ✓         ✓
Edit content    ✗         ✗            ✓         ✓
Share           ✗         ✗            ✗         ✓
Delete          ✗         ✗            ✗         ✓
Change owner    ✗         ✗            ✗         ✓
```

### Share Link Security
```
Link: docs.app/d/a1b2c3d4e5f6

Security options:
- Anyone with link (public)
- Anyone in organization
- Specific people only
- Expire after date
- Password required

## Complete Collaborative Editor Architecture

### What This System Does
This is the full Google Docs-like system combining real-time sync, presence, history, comments, permissions, and offline support into one integrated platform.

### How It Works Step-by-Step

**Step 1: User Opens Document**
Request flows through API Gateway → Auth check → Permission check → Document fetched

**Step 2: Real-time Connection**
WebSocket established → Join presence → Receive current document → Sync cursors

**Step 3: Collaborative Editing**
User edits → Local apply → Send to sync → Transform/merge → Broadcast → Others receive

**Step 4: Rich Features**
Comments attached → Suggestions made → History tracked → Versions snapshoted

**Step 5: Access Managed**
Sharing controlled → Links generated → Permissions enforced → Audit logged

**Step 6: Offline Works**
Connection lost → Local continues → Queue operations → Reconnect → Sync pending

### Full Component List

| Category | Components |
|----------|------------|
| Client | Web, Mobile, Desktop apps |
| Real-time | WebSocket, Presence, Cursors |
| Sync | OT/CRDT Engine, Conflict Resolution |
| Storage | Document Store, Version History |
| Features | Comments, Suggestions, Formatting |
| Access | Auth, Permissions, Sharing |
| Infrastructure | CDN, Load Balancer, Cache |

### Scale Numbers (Google Docs-like)
```
Concurrent documents: 10 million+
Operations per second: 1 million+
Max users per document: 100
Version history: Unlimited
Storage per doc: 50MB
```

### Architecture Principles
1. **Real-time First**: Sub-100ms latency for all syncs
2. **Conflict-free**: No user ever loses work
3. **Offline-capable**: Full functionality without internet
4. **Permission-strict**: Security at every layer
5. **History-complete**: Every change recoverable
